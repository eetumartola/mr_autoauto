There is a project plan with epics and a task list at `project_plan.md`. Track your progress by marking tasks as not started/done, or more granular info of the state/stage of the task if needed.
If we or you need to deviate from the plan, feel free to edit anything in the plan to keep it aligned with reality.
If we make decisions, new approaches, or anything that would be beneficial to remember in the future, please add notes to the plan document.

There is reference implementation of the neocortex web api use for chat and voice generation using rust at `reference/voice_api.txt`. Sadly there is a 2s latency, but we'll work with it.

Run tests/clippy after extensive changes
